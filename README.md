# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ do not have the same number of nodes, they
cannot be isomorphic. I have started with the formal definition of isomorphism
below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.


# Answer

We know that a one-to-one function is a function where a unique node from this domain is paired with another unique node of the codomain that we are given. We also know that a onto function is a function in which every node has a corresponding node from to codomain to the domain. 

With that in mind looking at this would tell us that each node corresponds with another node in another graph. With that following these functions we have to have the same amount of nodes and elements in each graph for it to be isomorphic. Now if one graph has a different amount of nodes then it would not follow the functions we listed above. We need both of the graphs to have the same number of nodes so that we can allow it to isomorphic.

# Sources 

I borrowed the slides from class and I looked up the pictures of one-to-one and onto. The reason I looked up pictures is that I wanted to have a better visual representation of the functions to get a better understanding of them. Other than that I did not look up anything else and did not borrow anyone's stuff.
